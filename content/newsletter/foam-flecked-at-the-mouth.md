description: Australia's freedom didn't last long; US equities smashed on a
  hawkish Fed and a poor jobs report; we wrote a letter on inflation; and the
  Djokovic border saga is not over yet.

intro: >-
  Good morning! What a few weeks it has been – we trust everyone managed to
  sneak in a nice break over summer, or winter for anyone unfortunate enough to
  be north of the equator at this time of year.


  Those on the east coast of Australia certainly seem to have have taken "reopening" to heart, given that Australia's daily COVID-19 case numbers have now [outstripped](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer) the UK, US, Canada, Germany,.. in fact, there aren't too many places in the world with more active coronavirus cases at the moment (adjusted for population, noting that ~10% of Australia – WA – is still closed off).


  The good news is that while COVID-19 hospitalisations are also soaring ([nearly 2,000](https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1479935971969748995) in NSW, or 50% above the prior peak), a good portion of them – somewhere between [20%](https://twitter.com/juliette_io/status/1478229464710479872) to [50%](https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/australia/up-to-half-of-nsw-covid-hospital-patients-went-in-for-something-totally-different-and-were-positive-in-routine-testing/news-story/603db6feed20422b3e8b57fd0e159fdb) or perhaps even as many as [65%](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/04/health/covid-omicron-hospitalizations.html) – are asymptomatic and checked in for an unrelated ailment, such as a broken bone.


  The reason for the massive range in the above estimates is because public health data in Australia are rubbish. Authorities clearly have the data but refuse to make them public, meaning all we get are sporadic releases from individual hospitals or snapshots when state health ministers decide to enlighten us.


  Such misleading data might explain why the number of people in ICU in NSW is still well below the previous peak (~40%) despite soaring hospitalisations, many of which are simply 'incidental'.


  Oh well, it is what it is (for now). The fact is hospital capacity is worsening regardless of severe disease due to soaring cases and the related staff absences, leading the NSW government to [reimpose restrictions](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/nsw-records-45-098-new-covid-cases-9-deaths-as-new-restrictions-come-into-force-20220108-p59mqy.html) over the weekend, limiting capacity at some venues and banning singing and dancing in hospitality venues.


  NSW is not alone in worrying about hospital capacity constraints, either – on Friday the VIC government [reintroduced](https://www.9news.com.au/national/coronavirus-update-victoria-covid19-new-cases-omicron-surge-restrictions-rapid-test-registration/00ac3144-3b57-4b96-9486-a78c7dfb288d) density limits and the QLD government [suspended](https://www.aap.com.au/news/qld-mulls-over-suspending-elective-surgery/) elective surgeries and [delayed the return](https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1479989891140227075) of the school year to 7 February.


  So much for "[we aren't going backwards](https://brekkywrap.com/2021/inaction-bias/)". 🤷‍♂️
marketcommentary: >-
  The **US S&P500** lost 0.41% on Friday, finishing down around 1.9% for the
  week after a huge selloff prompted by the release of Federal Reserve minutes
  [flagged](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/01/05/stocks-plunge-after-fed-minutes-show-central-bank-could-remove-more-stimulus/)
  a faster interest rate hiking cycle than market participants were expecting.
  The interest rate-sensitive, tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was hit particularly
  hard, ending the week down about 4.5% in what was its worst week since at
  least February 2021.


  A [jobs report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/hiring-falters-in-december-as-payrolls-rise-only-199000.html) released during trading on Friday only worsened sentiment, as it showed just 199,000 jobs were added in December, well below the 422,000 estimated. It also showed that US unemployment fell to just 3.9% with labour force participation at its lowest since 1977, as the so-called [Great Resignation](https://brekkywrap.com/2021/the-great-resignation/) continues on its merry way, with supply issues likely to persist if large numbers of people remain out of the workforce.


  Locally, the **ASX200** added 1.29% on Friday to finish the week up just 0.1% thanks to the large iron ore miners such as BHP (+5.4%), RIO (+3.5%) and FMG (+6.0%). But the big winners on Friday were private health insurers (e.g. Medibank +7.5%), after Queensland's government suspended elective surgeries until at least February, saving them a bundle of cash.

  🤝 Following the signing of a security pact between Australia and Japan, China's government responded by [saying it was](https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/groundless-accusations-chinas-fury-over-joint-statement-from-australia-and-japan/news-story/e2b6418d1afff46464c75fcacdaf7171) "in total disregard of the facts, makes groundless accusations against China on a series of issues related to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and unscrupulously interferes in China's internal affairs".

  🧐 Multiple [US Federal Reserve officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/business/economy/richard-clarida-fed-stock-fund.html) sold stocks only to buy them back days later, conveniently moving ahead of decisions by the Fed to actively rescue "a broad swath of markets".


  🐷 Evidence from offshore bank accounts [suggests that](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/717455) around 7.5% of all foreign aid is siphoned off to elites, increasing with the ratio of aid to GDP.

We kicked off the new year off by sending out an advance copy of the first ever *Unwrapped*, our new monthly newsletter, to all readers with 3+ referrals. Now that a week has passed we're making it available to everyone!

[​Click here to download *Unwrapped: Foam-flecked at the mouth*](https://brekkywrap.com/files/Unwrapped%20-%20Foam-flecked%20at%20the%20mouth%20-%20Jan%202022.pdf)

If you're too busy to read the whole thing, here’s the TL;DR:

* Inflation may overtake the pandemic as the media's headline-grabber of 2022.
* There are differing views about how to cure it and at least for now Australia remains one of the last countries firmly in the no worries, "transitory" camp.
* If monetary discipline fails in the war of ideas, policymakers may open Pandora's box of unintended consequences by resorting to long-since discredited techniques such as financial repression, price controls or even antitrust.

While we're on the subject of inflation, data on Friday showed that European consumer prices [jumped 5%](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-07/euro-area-inflation-unexpectedly-hits-record-to-test-ecb-resolve) from a year earlier in December, a fresh record high since the single currency was created more than two decades ago.

Poland's government then decided that [enough was enough](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/poland-cut-taxes-soften-inflation-blow-says-pm-2021-11-25/), cutting taxes on petrol, gas and electricity and providing cash payments to households. While that will reduce prices in the short-term, it comes at the cost of more debt and higher inflation in a year's time as the base effects drop out. If inflation persists, Poland's government will find itself in an even bigger crisis in the second half of 2022.

As we wrote in *Unwapped*, "inflation and more importantly how central bankers react to it could well be the new
headline-grabber of the year", so you had better get used to it!
