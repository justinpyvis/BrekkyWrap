description: Overseas tourists to be back Down Under by Easter; markets rallied
  hard despite soft data; Germany shrunk as much as France grew; and China's
  economy whimpered into 2022.

intro: >-
  Good morning! The rapidly improving COVID-19 situation in Australia led ScoMo
  [to
  reveal](https://7news.com.au/travel/tourism/prime-minister-scott-morrison-offers-timeline-on-when-international-tourists-are-set-to-return-to-australia--c-5476112)
  that international tourists may soon be allowed back into the country:


  > "I don't think it's too far away, to be honest, but we've got to get some medical advice further on that, a bit more work to do with the states to make sure we're comfortable about it.

  >

  > "And then I'd like to see us get there soon, certainly before Easter, well before Easter."


  Great news – another sign that life is *slowly* getting back to normal.


  Now we just have to hope that BA.2, also known as "Son of Omicron", is no more severe than its predecessor, given it's [estimated](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/28/the-new-bapoint2-omicron-subvariant-is-already-circulating-in-half-of-us-states.html) to be 1.5-times more transmissible. 🤞
marketcommentary: >-
  The **US S&P500** shot up 2.43% on Friday while the tech-heavy Nasdaq
  composite surged 3.13%, thanks to an upbeat [earnings
  report](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/)
  from Apple (the world's largest company by market cap).


  The end-of-week rally came [despite](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/28/key-fed-inflation-gauge-rises-4point9percent-from-a-year-ago-fastest-gain-since-1983.html) the core PCE price index – watched closely by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) – rising 4.9% in December, the most since September 1983, and the employment costs rising 4% from a year ago, the fastest in the 20-year history of the data.


  A separate report [showed](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-personal-income-rises-less-than-expected-personal-spending-slumps) personal income in the US increased a less than expected 0.3% in December, which after inflation made it a third straight month of -0.2% declines. 


  US consumer sentiment was also poor throughout January, with the [University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers](https://news.umich.edu/consumer-sentiment-sinks-to-decade-low/) "sinking to its lowest level since November 2011". The authors also claimed that the "wage-price spiral that has subsequently developed" is no longer linked to supply chain problems, and that household spending will likely turn negative when it's no longer being "supported by an extraordinary pace of rising home and stock prices".\

  \

  Locally, the **ASX200** finished the week up +2.19% in a broad-based rise with all 11 sectors – even tech! – finishing in the black in what was a rough week for the index which kicked off with four consecutive days of losses.

  ✈️ Elon Musk [reportedly](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/591708-elon-musk-offered-teen-5k-to-shut-down-twitter-account-tracking-his-private) offered $US5,000 to a 19-year-old to shut down a Twitter account that tracks his private flights, pleading "I don't love the idea of being shot by a nutcase."


  🌾 Sri Lanka's government is [paying compensation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/26/sri-lanka-200-million-compensation-farmers-organic-crops-drive) to over a million rice farmers "whose crops failed under a botched scheme to establish the world’s first 100-percent organic farming nation".


  🏡 Working from home saves the average employee about [70 minutes per day](https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/1486758498746699785), with half the time going to working more and the rest to increased leisure/errands. 


  ⚰️ Russia's population [officially declined](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/01/28/russias-pandemic-excess-death-toll-almost-1m-a76194) by more than one million people during 2021, with some 662,000 people succumbing to COVID-19 – more than double the government's official number "which uses a different methodology".

  🎾 It was a good Australian Open [for the locals](https://wwos.nine.com.au/tennis/australian-open-2022-final-live-results-scores-winner-ash-barty-danielle-collins-nick-kyrgios-thanasi-kokkinakis-womens-singles-mens-doubles/5fb4c66a-53ff-40cb-87ba-1b9177a5632d) with Ash Barty claiming the women's singles title while the pair of Kyrgios and Kokkinakis, aka "Special K", won the men's doubles.

It was certainly a wild end to the week in terms of economic news, which kicked off with December quarter GDP figures in Europe's two largest economies, Germany and France.

And talk about chalk and cheese! 

Germany's GDP dropped [by -0.7% from the prior quarter](https://think.ing.com/snaps/gerrmanys-winter-recession-part-one) in the December quarter, "mainly on the back of weak private consumption". The weakness followed increased coronavirus restrictions during the quarter coinciding with a spike in energy costs, the latter of which "will continue weighing on private consumption, even if social restrictions are lifted in the coming weeks".

Decommissioning all those nuclear power plants before having a reliable alternative in place that wasn't dependent on Russian gas probably wasn't the best idea... just a thought. 🙄

At the other end of the economic growth spectrum [was France](https://www.ft.com/content/92757d6d-1d7a-45e0-8b88-b4d18e5ace89), which "pulled away from its European neighbours with growth of 7% in 2021, the country's fastest expansion for 52 years".

In the December quarter alone the French economy grew 0.7% from the prior quarter, "boosted by a sharp rebound in consumer spending after coronavirus restrictions were eased last year, while also benefiting from its lower exposure to the global supply bottlenecks that have hit German manufacturers".

That will be music to President Emmanuel Macron's ears given he faces re-election in April.

Moving to Asia, South Korea's industrial production grew at 4.8% in 2021, the [fastest pace in 11 years](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220128000541), in what was a "rapid bounce-back from sagging performance in the pandemic-hit 2020". 

Retail sales also hit an 11-year high, growing 5.5% last year, although "indexes unveiled by the state-run agency suggest possible slowdown in the growth of production, retail sales and facilities investment for the coming months in 2022".

Speaking of slowdowns, China's manufacturing sector started 2022 with a "whimper" according to the January [Caixin PMI](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2022-01-30/china-manufacturing-starts-2022-off-with-a-whimper-caixin-pmi-shows-101836239.html), which fell to 49.1 in January – the lowest since February 2020 – from 50.9 in December (a reading above 50 indicates expansion).

No doubt Xi Jinping ordered factories in the region to reduce output in an attempt to keep the skies a shade of blue instead of the usual brown ahead of the Beijing Olympics, which kicks off on 4 February.

Down in South America, Argentina's government [struck a last-minute deal](https://www.ft.com/content/9ac4d53c-fafe-4e08-969d-d2ae927bc912) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to restructure $US44.5 billion of debt from its 2018 bailout, which it was finding difficult to service with inflation running at over 50% annually.

That should delay yet another full-blown currency crisis for at least a few more months!

Finally, another country that frequently struggles with inflation is Turkey, where inflation hit a 19-year high of 36% in December. But that's probably where it will stop, at least officially – instead of trying to deal with the problem by invoking some sort of fiscal and monetary discipline, President Erdogan did what all good leaders would do and... [sacked the head of the national statistical institute](https://www.ft.com/content/8ea4f3ea-cdbf-45ff-b4f1-d77451109453) after just 10 months in the role.

Problem solved! 🙈
