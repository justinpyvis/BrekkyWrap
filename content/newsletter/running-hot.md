description: Australia's labour market is running hot; ASIO's top spy gets
  political; VIC and NSW to remove restrictions early; and renewed tensions in
  Ukraine spook markets.

intro: >-
  Good morning! Mike Burgess, the head of the Australian Security Intelligence
  Organisation (ASIO) – Australia's spy bureau – took the very unusual step of
  weighing in on what has become a political hot potato on the eve of a federal
  election: China. Speaking to the ABC, [Burgess
  said](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-16/prime-minister-labels-labor-mp-manchurian-candidate/100837380):


  > "The foreign interference is against all members of parliament, so it doesn't go after one particular party or the other... I'll leave the politics to the politicians, but I'm very clear with everyone that I need to be that that's not helpful for us."


  His comments came following a couple of days of heated anti-China rhetoric in the media and Parliament, which kicked off after an [opinion piece](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202202/1252207.shtml) in the *Global Times*, a well-known Chinese government mouthpiece, that effectively endorsed Labor leader Anthony Albanese as China's preferred Prime Minister while labelling ScoMo "a clown".


  Seizing the opportunity to control the narrative ahead of the election, ScoMo said Albanese [was the](https://7news.com.au/politics/politicising-security-not-helpful-asio-c-5727431) "Chinese government's pick at this election".


  He then [followed that up](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2022/feb/17/scott-morrison-brands-labor-mp-a-manchurian-candidate-video) by accusing [](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2022/feb/17/scott-morrison-brands-labor-mp-a-manchurian-candidate-video)Labor frontbencher Richard Marles of being a "Manchurian candidate" (i.e. a puppet) in Parliament, citing a 2019 speech by Marles in Beijing calling for stronger ties between Australia and China.


  But wait, there's more! 


  Less than [24 hours later](https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/anthony-albanese-urges-closer-ties-with-china-in-unearthed-2018-video/news-story/33b522d3b47c1ed8b020c6cb63bbe160) a 2018 video conveniently emerged of Labor leader Anthony Albanese speaking in Mandarin, stating that "deepening ties with China is in Australia's national interest". Not helping Labor's cause was that the transcript on Albanese's official website just happened to be missing the statement in question.


  The Coalition certainly thinks it's onto a winner here – 'don't vote for the China sympathisers' will likely resonate with more people than 'hey we screwed up ordering vaccines, doubled the national debt and didn't manage to pass any of our election promises but please vote for us again'.


  Will it pay off? Time will tell...
marketcommentary: >-
  At the time of writing the **US S&P500** was down -1.97%, having steadily lost
  ground all session after [earlier in the
  morning](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/joe-biden-russia/index.html)
  US President Joe Biden said the chance of a Russian invasion of Ukraine was
  "very high", because:


  > "They have moved more troops in, number one. Number two, we have reason to believe they are engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in. Every indication we have is they are prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine... My sense is it will happen in the next several days."


  Locally, the **ASX200** eked out a small +0.16% gain thanks in large part to the healthcare sector (+3.0%), with biotech giant CSL adding another 5.0% to cap off a great couple of days following its 8.5% rise on Wednesday.


  At one stage the market was up nearly a full percent but lost ground late in the day after [reports started to emerge](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-mortar-shelling-latest-b2017002.html) from Europe that Ukraine government forces were firing mortars on Russian separatists in the east of the country.


  A notable mover in the negative direction was [conglomerate Wesfarmers](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-17/asx-wall-st-ukraine-russia-federal-reserve-wesfarmers/100838414), which plunged -7.5% after reporting a -14.2% decline in first-half profit "as a result of ongoing global supply-chain disruptions, elevated team member absenteeism and delays with third-party logistics providers".

The Australian [unemployment rate](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release) remained at 4.2% in January as the number of people participating in the labour market increased sufficiently to offset the 12,900 jobs created in the month.

Females in particular have been rushing back into the workforce, with their participation rising "to a new record high in January, at 62.1 per cent, which was around 0.9 percentage points higher than the start of the pandemic".

The employment to population ratio – useful as it's unaffected by seasonality and the short-run labour fluctuations so frequently seen during the pandemic – increased by 0.1 percentage points to 63.4%, or a full 1 percentage point above the pre-pandemic ratio.

The only piece of bad news was [hours worked](https://www.abs.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/hours-worked-fall-more-people-sick-or-leave), which plunged 4.9% as more "people than usual taking annual leave and sick leave in the first two weeks of January", likely due to "high numbers of COVID cases associated with the Omicron variant". The decline was most prevalent in NSW and VIC (-13.5% and -13.2%), the two states hardest hit by Omicron in early January.

But that's almost certainly a temporary blip – it's safe to say that Australia's labour market is running hot and next Wednesday's December quarter [wage price index](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/wage-price-index-australia/latest-release) will be keenly watched, although as with much of Australia's data it will already be horribly out of date by the time it's released. 

We're not sure why Australia's government struggles to produce timely, policy-critical data – countries such as Canada have already released inflation and wages data for January. Yet here we are, holding our breath for the October - December figures. 

It's certainly not due to a lack of funding: [Statistics Canada](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/ems-sgd/edb-bdd/index-eng.html#infographic/dept/313/financial/) has about the same annual budget [as the ABS](https://www.transparency.gov.au/annual-reports/australian-bureau-statistics/reporting-year/2020-21-22), yet Canada's population is nearly 50% larger.

But we digress. 

A hot labour market along with accelerating consumer price inflation (at least [anecdotally](https://www.afr.com/companies/retail/boral-jb-hi-fi-aurizon-costs-push-up-inflation-20220214-p59wdx)) should mean that wages are set to follow. However, there's a good chance they'll be negative in real terms – that's what we're seeing in many other advanced economies that are also 'running hot', as indicated by tight labour markets and nominal GDP [growing in the double-digits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Magh). 

There's a good chance that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will be in for quite a shock later this year when its data-driven models eventually catch up to what's happening in the real world. While Governor Lowe has spent the better part of two years [claiming the opposite](https://brekkywrap.com/2022/foam-flecked-at-the-mouth/), markets are [pricing in](https://www.asx.com.au/data/trt/ib_expectation_curve_graph.pdf) a rate rise as soon as June 2022.
