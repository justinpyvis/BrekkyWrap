<h3>Q: Brekky Wrap?</h3>
<p>Not to be mistaken for the delicious breakfast meal, Brekky Wrap is a daily newsletter that keeps you informed with the latest market, economic, political and tech news from Australia and beyond, for free. </p>

<p>As you might have gathered from the name, our emails are sent first thing in the morning (Australian time!), ready and waiting for you when you start work.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I sign up?</h3>
<p>That's easy â€“ simply enter your email in the box on our <a href="https://brekkywrap.com">home page</a>, click the yellow "Subscribe" button and we'll take care of the rest.</p>

<h3>Q: How often do you publish?</h3>
<p>Every Monday to Friday. The exact delivery time varies by season due to daylight savings but we aim to publish every Wrap before 5:00am Australian Western Standard Time.</p>

<p>We do not publish on Australian public holidays and usually take a few weeks off every year, which we'll broadcast well in advance on this page. During quiet times the size of the Wrap may be reduced, although we've yet to encounter any of those!</p>

<h3>Q: Nothing's truly free â€“ what's the catch?</h3>
<p>Brekky Wrap will always be free. However, at some point in the future we may need to partner with sponsors, affiliates or charge a fee for a premium service. But never fear, we'll communicate any changes well before implementation and you'll always be free to opt out by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email (but we'll miss you! ðŸ˜ž).</p>
